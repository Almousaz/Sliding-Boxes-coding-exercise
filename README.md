# Requirements 📋

- 📄 Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the starter code we handed you.
- 🔧 You are required to integrate the Reset CSS into the existing HTML file, ensuring that no other modifications are made to the HTML. This is more than a mere formality—it's the cornerstone of cross-browser consistency. 🌐
- 👀 Once that's in place, turn your eye to the CSS file accompanying it. You'll find a series of empty selectors, like blank canvases, awaiting your artistry. 🎨 Your challenge is to bring the provided design to life by filling in these selectors and these selectors only.
- 🛑 Remember, you can only use positioning rather than other CSS concepts like margins, flexbox, or floats. 📐
